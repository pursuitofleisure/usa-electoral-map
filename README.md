# Interactive USA Electoral Map for 2020
This is an interactive (SVG) map of USA states with the ability to click on each state to change the electoral vote totals for each candidate. The states/votes for each candidate are stored in an array with the ability to view each state won by each candidate. When I was a kid I got a homework assignment once to color in using crayons a map of the United States on Election Day, and since I still enjoiy filling in the states, I thought it would be nice to build my own tool using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
